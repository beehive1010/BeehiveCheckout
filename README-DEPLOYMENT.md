# Production Deployment Fix

## Problem
The original deployment was failing because the `start` script used `vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000`, which is meant for development testing, not production deployment.

## Solution
Since the package.json cannot be modified directly, this fix provides an alternative production startup method using the `serve` package.

## Usage

### For Production Deployment
Instead of using `npm start` (which still runs vite preview), use:

```bash
# Build the application first
npm run build

# Start the production server
node start-production.js
```

### Alternative Direct Method
You can also run serve directly:

```bash
npm run build
npx serve -s dist -l 5000 --host 0.0.0.0
```

## What This Fixes
- ✅ Uses proper static file server instead of Vite preview
- ✅ Serves Single Page Application correctly with client-side routing
- ✅ Runs on the correct host (0.0.0.0) and port (5000)
- ✅ Handles production deployment properly

## Files Added
- `start-production.js` - Production startup script that uses serve
- `README-DEPLOYMENT.md` - This documentation

## Dependencies
- `serve` package (already installed) - Production static file server

## For Deployment Platforms
Configure your deployment to run:
1. `npm run build` (build step)
2. `node start-production.js` (start step)

This replaces the problematic `npm start` command that was using vite preview.
