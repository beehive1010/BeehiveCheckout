# Migration Fix Summary: Critical Data Integrity Issues

**Migration File**: `/home/ubuntu/WebstormProjects/BEEHIVE/supabase/migrations/20251003_fix_critical_data_integrity.sql`

**Date**: October 3, 2025

**Based On**: Comprehensive Audit Report dated October 2, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This migration addresses **9 critical and high-priority data integrity issues** identified in the database audit. All fixes are **idempotent** and safe to run multiple times. The migration includes comprehensive pre-flight and post-flight validation with detailed logging.

---

## Issues Fixed (in priority order)

### ✅ Fix 1: CRITICAL-1.1 - Upgrade L0 Members to L1
**Problem**: 42 members stuck at Level 0 after activation
**Impact**: Members cannot earn rewards while at Level 0
**Solution**:
- Updated all activated members with `current_level = 0` to `current_level = 1`
- Business rule: All activated members must be at least Level 1

```sql
UPDATE members SET current_level = 1
WHERE current_level = 0 AND activation_time IS NOT NULL;
```

**Expected Result**: 0 members at Level 0 after activation

---

### ✅ Fix 2: CRITICAL-4.1 - Fix Layer 0 Reward
**Problem**: 1 layer reward with invalid `matrix_layer = 0`
**Impact**: Violates 1-19 layer constraint
**Solution**: Updated to `matrix_layer = 1`

```sql
UPDATE layer_rewards SET matrix_layer = 1 WHERE matrix_layer = 0;
```

**Expected Result**: 0 rewards with `matrix_layer = 0`

---

### ✅ Fix 3: CRITICAL-2.1 - Create Missing Direct Referral Records
**Problem**: 10+ members have `referrer_wallet` but no referral record with `is_direct_referral=true`
**Impact**: Direct rewards not created; referral chain broken
**Solution**:
- Created missing referral records with proper matrix root assignment
- Used BFS to find correct `matrix_root_wallet` from existing referrals
- Set `is_direct_referral = true` and `matrix_layer = 1`

```sql
INSERT INTO referrals (member_wallet, referrer_wallet, matrix_root_wallet, ...)
SELECT m.wallet_address, m.referrer_wallet, ...
FROM members m LEFT JOIN referrals r ON ...
WHERE m.referrer_wallet IS NOT NULL AND r.id IS NULL
```

**Expected Result**: All members with referrers now have direct referral records

---

### ✅ Fix 4: CRITICAL-3.2 - Enforce Direct Reward Level Gates
**Problem**: L1 members have 3-10 claimable direct rewards (should cap at 2)
**Business Rule Violation**:
- 1st & 2nd rewards require Level 1+
- 3rd+ rewards require Level 2+

**Impact**: 10+ referrers with excessive claimable rewards
**Solution**:
- Numbered all direct rewards per referrer by creation date
- Changed 3rd+ rewards to `status='pending'` for L1 members
- Set `expires_at = NOW() + 72 hours`
- Created reward timers for newly pending rewards

```sql
WITH ranked_rewards AS (
  SELECT id, referrer_wallet, current_level,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY referrer_wallet ORDER BY created_at) as reward_num
  FROM direct_referral_rewards JOIN members ...
)
UPDATE direct_referral_rewards SET status = 'pending', expires_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '72 hours'
WHERE reward_num > 2 AND current_level = 1
```

**Expected Result**: L1 members have max 2 claimable direct rewards

---

### ✅ Fix 5: HIGH-4.2 - Fix Claimable Rewards Failing Level Gate
**Problem**: 3 claimable rewards where `recipient_current_level < recipient_required_level`
**Impact**: Business rule violation
**Solution**: Demoted to `status='pending'` with 72-hour timer

```sql
UPDATE layer_rewards SET status = 'pending', expires_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '72 hours'
WHERE status = 'claimable' AND recipient_current_level < recipient_required_level
```

**Expected Result**: All claimable rewards meet level requirements

---

### ✅ Fix 6: WARNING-4.3 - Promote Qualified Pending Rewards
**Problem**: 8 pending rewards meet all requirements but not promoted
**Impact**: Members waiting unnecessarily for qualified rewards
**Solution**:
- Promoted pending → claimable where all gates met
- Deactivated timers for promoted rewards

```sql
UPDATE layer_rewards SET status = 'claimable'
WHERE status = 'pending'
  AND recipient_current_level >= recipient_required_level
  AND (NOT requires_direct_referrals OR direct_referrals_current >= direct_referrals_required)
```

**Expected Result**: Pending rewards auto-promoted when qualified

---

### ✅ Fix 7: WARNING-6.1 - Create Missing Timers for Pending Rewards
**Problem**: 23 pending rewards without active timers
**Impact**: Rewards won't auto-expire or promote
**Solution**: Created timers for all pending rewards without timers

```sql
INSERT INTO reward_timers (reward_id, recipient_wallet, timer_type, expires_at, is_active)
SELECT lr.id, lr.reward_recipient_wallet,
       CASE WHEN lr.recipient_required_level - lr.recipient_current_level > 0
            THEN 'level_requirement_pending'
            ELSE 'layer_qualification_wait' END,
       COALESCE(lr.expires_at, NOW() + INTERVAL '72 hours'),
       true
FROM layer_rewards lr LEFT JOIN reward_timers rt ON lr.id = rt.reward_id
WHERE lr.status = 'pending' AND rt.id IS NULL
```

**Expected Result**: All pending rewards have active timers

---

### ✅ Fix 8: CRITICAL-7.1 & 7.2 - Reconcile All Balances
**Problem**:
- 10+ members with `available_balance ≠ (earned - withdrawn)`
- Members have claimable rewards but `available_balance = 0`
- $7,100+ USDT not reflected in balances

**Impact**: Members can't see or withdraw earned rewards; trust issue
**Solution**: Comprehensive balance reconciliation from reward data

**Algorithm**:
1. Calculate total from BOTH `direct_referral_rewards` (where member is referrer) AND `layer_rewards` (where member is recipient)
2. Sum by status: `claimable` + `claimed` = `total_earned`
3. Sum claimed only = `reward_claimed`
4. Sum claimable only = `reward_balance`
5. Calculate: `available_balance = total_earned - total_withdrawn`

```sql
WITH reward_totals AS (
  SELECT m.wallet_address,
         SUM(drr.reward_amount) FILTER (WHERE drr.status IN ('claimable','claimed')) as direct_total,
         SUM(drr.reward_amount) FILTER (WHERE drr.status = 'claimable') as direct_claimable,
         SUM(lr.reward_amount) FILTER (WHERE lr.status IN ('claimable','claimed')) as layer_total,
         SUM(lr.reward_amount) FILTER (WHERE lr.status = 'claimable') as layer_claimable,
         ...
  FROM members m
  LEFT JOIN direct_referral_rewards drr ON m.wallet_address = drr.referrer_wallet
  LEFT JOIN layer_rewards lr ON m.wallet_address = lr.reward_recipient_wallet
  GROUP BY m.wallet_address
)
UPDATE user_balances ub SET
  total_earned = rt.direct_total + rt.layer_total,
  reward_balance = rt.direct_claimable + rt.layer_claimable,
  available_balance = (rt.direct_total + rt.layer_total) - ub.total_withdrawn,
  ...
```

**Expected Result**:
- `available_balance = total_earned - total_withdrawn` (within 0.01 tolerance)
- All claimable rewards reflected in balances
- 0 balance mismatches

---

## Validation & Safety Features

### Pre-Flight Validation
The migration logs the system state before any changes:
- Count of L0 members
- Count of missing referral records
- Count of balance mismatches
- Count of layer 0 rewards

### Post-Flight Validation
After all fixes, the migration verifies:
- 0 L0 members remaining
- 0 missing referral records
- 0 balance mismatches
- 0 layer 0 rewards
- 0 direct reward gate violations
- 0 pending rewards without timers

### Idempotency
All operations are safe to run multiple times:
- `UPDATE` operations use `WHERE` clauses that won't match after first run
- `INSERT` operations use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
- All checks are conditional (no destructive operations)

### Transaction Safety
- Entire migration wrapped in `BEGIN...COMMIT`
- Rollback possible if any error occurs
- Detailed `RAISE NOTICE` logging throughout

---

## Verification Queries

After running the migration, verify success with these queries:

```sql
-- Should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM members
WHERE current_level = 0 AND activation_time IS NOT NULL;

-- Should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM members m
LEFT JOIN referrals r ON m.wallet_address = r.member_wallet AND r.is_direct_referral = true
WHERE m.referrer_wallet IS NOT NULL AND r.id IS NULL AND m.activation_sequence != 0;

-- Should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_balances
WHERE ABS(available_balance - (total_earned - total_withdrawn)) > 0.01;

-- Should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM layer_rewards WHERE matrix_layer = 0;

-- Should return 0 for L1 members with > 2 claimable
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
  SELECT drr.referrer_wallet, m.current_level,
         COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE drr.status = 'claimable') as claimable_count
  FROM direct_referral_rewards drr
  INNER JOIN members m ON drr.referrer_wallet = m.wallet_address
  GROUP BY drr.referrer_wallet, m.current_level
) agg WHERE current_level = 1 AND claimable_count > 2;

-- Should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM layer_rewards lr
LEFT JOIN reward_timers rt ON lr.id = rt.reward_id AND rt.is_active = true
WHERE lr.status = 'pending' AND rt.id IS NULL;
```

---

## Issues NOT Fixed (Require Architectural Changes)

The following issues from the audit report require **manual intervention** or **separate migrations** with complex matrix tree reconstruction:

### ❌ CRITICAL-5.1: Super Root Has 4 Children
**Issue**: `0x0000...0001` has 4 children in layer 1 (violates 3×3 rule)
**Reason Not Fixed**: Requires manual decision on which child to move
**Recommendation**: Identify 4th child and reassign to correct spillover position

### ❌ CRITICAL-5.2: Duplicate Matrix Positions
**Issue**: 2 positions with multiple members assigned
**Reason Not Fixed**: Requires BFS reconstruction to determine correct assignments
**Recommendation**: Rebuild affected matrix subtrees

### ❌ CRITICAL-5.3: Invalid Parent References
**Issue**: 10+ nodes reference parents that don't exist in matrix
**Reason Not Fixed**: Requires parent node creation or child reassignment
**Recommendation**: Either create missing parent nodes or reassign orphaned children

### ❌ HIGH-3.3: 10 Expired Direct Rewards Not Rolled Up
**Issue**: Expired rewards not rolled to qualified upline
**Reason Not Fixed**: Roll-up logic not implemented for direct rewards
**Recommendation**: Implement `roll_up_expired_direct_rewards()` function

---

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure Supabase CLI is installed and configured
2. Verify database connection: `PGSSLMODE=require psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT NOW();"`
3. Link to project: `supabase link --project-ref <PROJECT_REF>`

### Deployment Steps

1. **Verify Migration Files**:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/WebstormProjects/BEEHIVE
ls -lh supabase/migrations/20251003_fix_critical_data_integrity.sql
```

2. **Run Migration**:
```bash
supabase db push
```

3. **Monitor Output**:
Look for these success messages in the logs:
- "Updated X members from Level 0 to Level 1"
- "Fixed X rewards with matrix_layer = 0"
- "Created X missing direct referral records"
- "Changed X excess direct rewards from claimable to pending"
- "Reconciled balances for X members"
- "=== ALL CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED SUCCESSFULLY ==="

4. **Verify Fixes**:
```bash
# Connect to database
psql "$DATABASE_URL"

# Run verification queries (see section above)
```

5. **Check for Warnings**:
If any warnings appear in logs, investigate specific accounts:
```sql
-- Example: Find remaining L0 members
SELECT wallet_address, activation_time, current_level
FROM members
WHERE current_level = 0 AND activation_time IS NOT NULL;
```

---

## Expected Impact

### Before Migration
- 42 members stuck at L0 (cannot earn)
- 10+ missing referral records
- 10+ members with $0 balance but claimable rewards
- $7,100+ USDT not reflected in balances
- L1 members with 3-10 claimable direct rewards (should max at 2)
- 23 pending rewards without expiry timers

### After Migration
- ✅ All activated members at Level 1+
- ✅ All members have referral records
- ✅ All balances accurate (available = earned - withdrawn)
- ✅ All claimable rewards reflected in balances
- ✅ Direct reward gates enforced (L1 capped at 2)
- ✅ All pending rewards have timers
- ✅ System integrity restored for reward distribution

---

## Rollback Strategy

If issues occur:

1. **Immediate Rollback** (if migration fails mid-transaction):
   - Migration will auto-rollback due to `BEGIN...COMMIT` wrapper
   - No changes will be applied

2. **Post-Deployment Rollback** (if migration succeeds but causes issues):
   - NOT RECOMMENDED (data already corrected)
   - Manual reversal would require re-introducing data integrity violations
   - Instead, identify specific issue and apply targeted fix

3. **Partial Rollback** (if specific fix causes issue):
   - Each fix is isolated in a DO block
   - Can manually reverse specific changes if needed
   - Example: Revert balance sync for specific account

---

## Monitoring & Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 24 Hours)
1. ✅ Run verification queries hourly for first 6 hours
2. ✅ Monitor for new L0 members (should not occur)
3. ✅ Check for new balance mismatches (should not occur)
4. ✅ Verify direct reward gates holding (L1 members capped at 2)

### Short-Term (Next Week)
