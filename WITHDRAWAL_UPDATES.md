# Withdrawal System Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. USDTWithdrawal Component Simplified
**File**: `src/components/withdrawal/USDTWithdrawal.tsx`

#### Removed:
- ❌ Token selection dropdown (selectedToken state)
- ❌ Multi-token support UI
- ❌ Cross-chain token conversion warnings

#### Changed To:
- ✅ **USDT Only** - All withdrawals are in USDT
- ✅ Clean info card showing withdrawal currency
- ✅ Simplified user experience

#### Before:
```tsx
const [selectedToken, setSelectedToken] = useState('USDT');
// Token selection dropdown with multiple options
<Select value={selectedToken} onValueChange={setSelectedToken}>
  <SelectItem value="USDT">...</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="ETH">...</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="ARB">...</SelectItem>
</Select>
```

#### After:
```tsx
// No token selection needed - always USDT
<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-cyan-50...">
  <p>USDT (Tether)</p>
  <p>Stablecoin on {targetChainInfo?.name}</p>
</div>
```

### 2. Backend Integration
- ✅ `targetTokenSymbol` always set to `'USDT'`
- ✅ Removed unused token selection logic
- ✅ Cleaner withdrawal request payload
