# Edge Functions Database Setup - Complete

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Database Structure Issues
- **Fixed ROUND function errors** in matrix views and functions
- **Created missing helper functions** for edge function support
- **Aligned database views** with TypeScript database types

### 2. Created Comprehensive Edge Functions

**Purpose**: Complete member management operations
**Actions Available**:
- `get-member-info` - Get basic member information
- `get-complete-info` - Get complete user info using `user_complete_info` view
- `get-matrix-status` - Get matrix placement and statistics
- `get-balance-details` - Get detailed balance using `user_balance_summary` view
- `list-members` - List members with pagination and filtering
- `get-member-stats` - Get member statistics (referrals, rewards)
- `get-referral-tree` - Get hierarchical referral tree
- `system-stats` - Get overall system statistics
- `update-member` - Update member information (limited fields)
- `sync-member-data` - Sync member data across tables

#### B. `matrix-operations/index.ts`
**Purpose**: Matrix placement and referral operations
**Actions Available**:
- `get-matrix-structure` - Get matrix structure analysis
- `get-placement-info` - Get placement information for a member
- `find-optimal-placement` - Find best placement position for new member
- `place-member` - Place a member in the matrix (with reward triggers)
- `get-matrix-statistics` - Get matrix statistics
- `get-layer-analysis` - Analyze specific layer of matrix
- `check-spillover-opportunities` - Find spillover placement opportunities
- `sync-matrix-data` - Sync matrix layer summaries
- `get-reward-eligibility` - Check reward eligibility for member
- `simulate-placement` - Simulate placement without actually placing

### 3. Created Database Views for Edge Functions

#### A. `user_complete_info`
Complete user information combining:
- User basic info (username, email, role)
- Admin info (if applicable)
- Member info (level, activation status)
- Balance info (BCC, USDC)
- Overall status classification

#### B. `user_balance_summary`
Comprehensive balance information:
- BCC balances (locked, transferable, total)
- USDC balances (claimable, pending, claimed)
- Tier information
- Member status

#### C. `member_status_detail`
Detailed member status:
- Activation information
- NFT claim status
- Balance summary
- Referral statistics
- Overall member classification

#### D. `member_matrix_status`
Matrix placement information:
- Current matrix placement
- Root and referrer information
- Team size statistics
- Matrix placement status

### 4. Created Support Functions

#### A. `get_current_activation_tier()`
Returns current tier information based on activation count

#### B. `get_next_activation_rank()`
Returns next sequential activation rank

#### C. `create_member_from_membership()`
Creates member record from activated membership

#### D. Matrix analysis functions:
- `get_matrix_system_overview()` - System-wide matrix statistics
- `check_matrix_health()` - Matrix health assessment
- `analyze_matrix_structure()` - Detailed matrix analysis

### 5. Fixed Database Compatibility Issues
- **Column reference errors** - All views now use correct table.column references
- **Type casting issues** - Fixed ROUND function with proper NUMERIC casting
- **Missing indexes** - Added indexes for performance
- **Foreign key relationships** - Ensured proper referential integrity

## ðŸš€ Edge Functions Usage

### Member Management
```typescript
// Get complete member info
fetch('/functions/v1/member-management?action=get-complete-info', {
  headers: { 'x-wallet-address': '0x...' }
})

// List members with pagination
fetch('/functions/v1/member-management?action=list-members&limit=20&offset=0')

// Get member statistics
fetch('/functions/v1/member-management?action=get-member-stats', {
  headers: { 'x-wallet-address': '0x...' }
})
```

### Matrix Operations
```typescript
// Find optimal placement
fetch('/functions/v1/matrix-operations?action=find-optimal-placement&referrer_wallet=0x...', {
  headers: { 'x-wallet-address': '0x...' }
})

// Place member in matrix
fetch('/functions/v1/matrix-operations?action=place-member', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    referred_wallet: '0x...',
    referrer_wallet: '0x...',
    placement_root: '0x...',
    placement_layer: 1,
    placement_position: 'L'
  })
})

// Get matrix statistics
fetch('/functions/v1/matrix-operations?action=get-matrix-statistics', {
  headers: { 'x-wallet-address': '0x...' }
})
```
