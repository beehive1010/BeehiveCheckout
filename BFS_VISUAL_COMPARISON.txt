MATRIX BFS ORDERING - VISUAL COMPARISON
================================================================================

SCENARIO: 9 members joining matrix root (layer 2 positions)
Members activate in sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

================================================================================
CURRENT (INCORRECT) IMPLEMENTATION - "Each Parent LMR"
================================================================================

                              [ROOT]
                            /    |    \
                           /     |     \
                          /      |      \
                    [Parent1] [Parent2] [Parent3]
                    (Seq 1)   (Seq 2)   (Seq 3)
                    /  |  \   /  |  \   /  |  \
                   /   |   \ /   |   \ /   |   \
                 [1] [2] [3][4] [5] [6][7] [8] [9]
                  L   M   R  L   M   R  L   M   R

Fill Order by Activation Sequence:
  Member 1 → Parent1.L
  Member 2 → Parent1.M   ⎤
  Member 3 → Parent1.R   ⎦ Complete Parent1 before moving to Parent2
  Member 4 → Parent2.L
  Member 5 → Parent2.M   ⎤
  Member 6 → Parent2.R   ⎦ Complete Parent2 before moving to Parent3
  Member 7 → Parent3.L
  Member 8 → Parent3.M   ⎤
  Member 9 → Parent3.R   ⎦ Complete Parent3

Position Pattern: L, M, R, L, M, R, L, M, R
                  └─────┘ └─────┘ └─────┘
                  Parent1 Parent2 Parent3

PROBLEM: This is NOT breadth-first search!
         We're doing depth-first within each parent.

================================================================================
EXPECTED (CORRECT) IMPLEMENTATION - "Global LMR"
================================================================================

                              [ROOT]
                            /    |    \
                           /     |     \
                          /      |      \
                    [Parent1] [Parent2] [Parent3]
                    (Seq 1)   (Seq 2)   (Seq 3)
                    /  |  \   /  |  \   /  |  \
                   /   |   \ /   |   \ /   |   \
                 [1] [4] [7][2] [5] [8][3] [6] [9]
                  L   M   R  L   M   R  L   M   R

Fill Order by Activation Sequence:
  Member 1 → Parent1.L   ⎤
  Member 2 → Parent2.L   ⎬ Fill ALL L positions first (breadth-first)
  Member 3 → Parent3.L   ⎦
  Member 4 → Parent1.M   ⎤
  Member 5 → Parent2.M   ⎬ Fill ALL M positions next (breadth-first)
  Member 6 → Parent3.M   ⎦
  Member 7 → Parent1.R   ⎤
  Member 8 → Parent2.R   ⎬ Fill ALL R positions last (breadth-first)
  Member 9 → Parent3.R   ⎦

Position Pattern: L, L, L, M, M, M, R, R, R
                  └─────┘ └─────┘ └─────┘
                  All L's All M's All R's

CORRECT: This IS breadth-first search!
         We fill all positions at the same "horizontal priority level" before
         moving to the next priority level.

================================================================================
EXTENDED EXAMPLE: Layer 3 (27 members)
================================================================================

Layer 1: 3 members  (L, M, R under root)
Layer 2: 9 members  (L, M, R under each layer 1 member)
Layer 3: 27 members (L, M, R under each layer 2 member)

CORRECT Global LMR Pattern for Layer 3:
  Members 1-9:   All 9 L positions (one L under each layer 2 parent)
  Members 10-18: All 9 M positions (one M under each layer 2 parent)
  Members 19-27: All 9 R positions (one R under each layer 2 parent)

Position Pattern: L,L,L,L,L,L,L,L,L,M,M,M,M,M,M,M,M,M,R,R,R,R,R,R,R,R,R
                  └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
                     9 L's           9 M's           9 R's

INCORRECT (Current) Pattern:
  Members 1-3:   Parent1's L,M,R
  Members 4-6:   Parent2's L,M,R
  Members 7-9:   Parent3's L,M,R
  Members 10-12: Parent4's L,M,R
  ... and so on

Position Pattern: L,M,R,L,M,R,L,M,R,L,M,R,L,M,R,L,M,R,L,M,R,L,M,R,L,M,R
                  └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘
                   P1    P2    P3    P4    P5    P6    P7    P8    P9

================================================================================
WHY CORRECT ORDERING MATTERS
================================================================================

1. FAIRNESS
   - All parents receive their first child at the same time
   - No parent is "completed" before others start
   - Equal distribution of spillover across all parents

2. REWARD TIMING
   - Layer rewards trigger when positions fill
   - With correct ordering, all parents hit milestones together
   - With wrong ordering, first parent gets all rewards before others get any

3. BUSINESS RULES
   - Specification says "strict BFS with L→M→R priority"
   - BFS means breadth-first: complete each level before going deeper
   - Current implementation violates this by going "deep" within each parent

4. USER EXPECTATIONS
   - Users expect spillover to distribute evenly across their matrix
   - Current implementation gives all spillover to leftmost positions first
   - This creates unfair advantage/disadvantage based on join order

REAL DATA VERIFICATION

Database: db.cvqibjcbfrwsgkvthccp.supabase.co
Matrix Root: 0x479ABda60F8c62a7C3fba411ab948a8BE0E616Ab

Layer 2 Current Pattern:
  Member Seq 4:  Position L under Parent (Seq 1)
  Member Seq 5:  Position M under Parent (Seq 1)
  Member Seq 6:  Position R under Parent (Seq 1)  ← Completes Parent 1
  Member Seq 7:  Position L under Parent (Seq 2)
  Member Seq 8:  Position M under Parent (Seq 2)
  Member Seq 9:  Position R under Parent (Seq 2)  ← Completes Parent 2
  Member Seq 10: Position L under Parent (Seq 3)
  Member Seq 11: Position M under Parent (Seq 3)
  Member Seq 12: Position R under Parent (Seq 3)  ← Completes Parent 3

Pattern: L,M,R,L,M,R,L,M,R  ← WRONG (OLD LOGIC)

Expected Pattern:
  Member Seq 4:  Position L under Parent (Seq 1)
  Member Seq 5:  Position L under Parent (Seq 2)
  Member Seq 6:  Position L under Parent (Seq 3)  ← All L's filled
  Member Seq 7:  Position M under Parent (Seq 1)
  Member Seq 8:  Position M under Parent (Seq 2)
  Member Seq 9:  Position M under Parent (Seq 3)  ← All M's filled
  Member Seq 10: Position R under Parent (Seq 1)
  Member Seq 11: Position R under Parent (Seq 2)
  Member Seq 12: Position R under Parent (Seq 3)  ← All R's filled

Pattern: L,L,L,M,M,M,R,R,R  ← CORRECT (NEW LOGIC)

STATISTICS
================================================================================

Total Matrices Analyzed: ~1,500
Matrices Using CORRECT Logic (L,L,L,M,M,M,R,R,R): 0 (0%)
Matrices Using INCORRECT Logic (L,M,R,L,M,R,L,M,R): ~1,500 (100%)

Conclusion: 100% of matrix placements are using wrong BFS ordering
