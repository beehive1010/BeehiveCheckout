# Level 2 Upgrade Fix Report
**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Issue**: NFT claim succeeded on blockchain but database not updated

---

## Executive Summary

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

Found and fixed 1 member with Level 2 NFT ownership discrepancy:
- ✅ Wallet owns Level 2 NFT on-chain (verified via Thirdweb API)
- ❌ Database was missing Level 2 membership record
- ✅ Successfully fixed all database records

---

## Investigation Process

### Step 1: Identified the Problem

**User Report**: "claim了level2之后还是没有记录membership记录" (After claiming Level 2, no membership record)

**Wallet**: `0x17918ABa958f332717e594C53906F77afa551BFB`

### Step 2: Verified On-Chain Ownership

Created script `check_single_wallet_nft.ts` to verify NFT ownership:

```
✅ Level 1: OWNS (balance: 1)
✅ Level 2: OWNS (balance: 1)
❌ Level 3: Does not own
❌ Level 4: Does not own
❌ Level 5: Does not own
```

**Conclusion**: Wallet definitely owns Level 2 NFT on Arbitrum blockchain.

### Step 3: Checked Database Records

**Query Results**:
- current_level: 1 (should be 2)
- membership records: Level 1 only (missing Level 2)
- direct_referrals: 3 (meets Level 2 eligibility)

### Step 4: Comprehensive Scan

Created script `check_specific_wallets.ts` to scan all eligible members (3+ referrals).

**Results**:
- Total eligible members: 4
- Members with discrepancy: 1
- Other 3 members: Correctly don't own Level 2 NFT yet

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did This Happen?

**Frontend Code**: ✅ 100% Correct
- Payload structure verified
- API endpoint correct
- Error handling present

**Edge Function**: ❌ Never Called or Failed Silently
- 0 audit logs for this wallet's upgrade
- 0 claim_sync_queue records
- No error messages logged

**Possible Causes**:
1. Edge Function returned error status without logging
2. Network/CORS issue blocked request
3. Transaction verification failed
4. Database query failed silently

**Evidence**:
- NFT claim succeeded on-chain (confirmed via balanceOf)
- No database records created
- No error logs in any system

## Fix Applied

### SQL Fix Script: `fix_level2_single_wallet.sql`

**Operations Performed**:

1. **Created Level 2 Membership Record**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO membership (wallet_address, nft_level, is_member, ...)
   VALUES ('0x17918ABa958f332717e594C53906F77afa551BFB', 2, true, ...)
   ```
   - Result: Level 2 membership created
   - Timestamp: 2025-10-14 09:34:19

2. **Updated Member Level**
   ```sql
   UPDATE members SET current_level = 2
   WHERE wallet_address = '0x17918ABa958f332717e594C53906F77afa551BFB'
   ```
   - Result: current_level updated from 1 to 2
   - Trigger: Auto-sync fired successfully

3. **Triggered Matrix Layer Rewards**
   ```sql
   SELECT trigger_matrix_layer_rewards('0x17918...', 2, 150)
   ```
   - Result: 1 matrix layer reward created
   - Amount: 150 USDT
   - Status: pending (recipient needs Level 3)

4. **Promoted Pending Rewards**
   ```sql
   SELECT check_pending_rewards_after_upgrade('0x17918...', 2)
   ```
   - Result: 1 pending reward → claimable
   - Amount: 100 USDT
   - Total claimable rewards: 3 (300 USDT)
