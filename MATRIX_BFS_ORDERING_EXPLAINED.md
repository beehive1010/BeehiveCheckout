# Matrix BFS Ordering - Visual Explanation

## The Problem: OLD Logic vs NEW (Correct) Logic

### Matrix Structure (3x3 Ternary Tree)
```
Layer 0:                  [ROOT]
                          /  |  \
Layer 1:              [L]  [M]  [R]
                      /|\  /|\  /|\
Layer 2:           [L M R][L M R][L M R]
                    (9 positions total)
```

---

## Scenario: Adding 9 members to Layer 2

Members activate in this order: Member 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

### INCORRECT (Current Implementation) - "Each Parent LMR"

**Logic**: Fill each parent's L, M, R before moving to next parent

```
Layer 1:              [Parent1]  [Parent2]  [Parent3]
                      /    |   \  /   |   \  /   |   \
Layer 2:            [1]  [2]  [3][4] [5] [6][7] [8] [9]
                     L    M    R  L   M   R  L   M   R

Positions:           L    M    R  L   M   R  L   M   R
Member Sequence:     1    2    3  4   5   6  7   8   9
```

**Fill Order**: 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9
**Position Pattern**: L,M,R,L,M,R,L,M,R

**Problem**: Not true BFS! We're completing each parent's children before moving to the next parent.

---

### CORRECT (Fixed Implementation) - "Global LMR"

**Logic**: Fill ALL parents' L positions first, then ALL M positions, then ALL R positions

```
Layer 1:              [Parent1]  [Parent2]  [Parent3]
                      /    |   \  /   |   \  /   |   \
Layer 2:            [1]  [4]  [7][2] [5] [8][3] [6] [9]
                     L    M    R  L   M   R  L   M   R

Positions:           L    M    R  L   M   R  L   M   R
Member Sequence:     1    4    7  2   5   8  3   6   9
```

**Fill Order**: 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9
**Position Pattern**: L,L,L,M,M,M,R,R,R

**Why This is Correct BFS**:
- Members 1, 2, 3: Fill all L positions (left-most child of each parent)
- Members 4, 5, 6: Fill all M positions (middle child of each parent)
- Members 7, 8, 9: Fill all R positions (right-most child of each parent)

## Real Data Example

### Matrix Root: 0x479ABda60F8c62a7C3fba411ab948a8BE0E616Ab

#### Current (Wrong) Implementation:
```
Layer 2 Members by Activation Sequence:

Seq 4:  Position L under Parent (Seq 1)
Seq 5:  Position M under Parent (Seq 1)  ← Completes Parent 1
Seq 6:  Position R under Parent (Seq 1)
Seq 7:  Position L under Parent (Seq 2)
Seq 8:  Position M under Parent (Seq 2)  ← Completes Parent 2
Seq 9:  Position R under Parent (Seq 2)
Seq 10: Position L under Parent (Seq 3)
Seq 11: Position M under Parent (Seq 3)  ← Completes Parent 3
Seq 12: Position R under Parent (Seq 3)
```

Pattern: **L,M,R,L,M,R,L,M,R** (OLD LOGIC)

---

#### Expected (Correct) Implementation:
```
Layer 2 Members by Activation Sequence:

Seq 4:  Position L under Parent (Seq 1)
Seq 5:  Position L under Parent (Seq 2)  ← Fill all L's first
Seq 6:  Position L under Parent (Seq 3)
Seq 7:  Position M under Parent (Seq 1)
Seq 8:  Position M under Parent (Seq 2)  ← Fill all M's next
Seq 9:  Position M under Parent (Seq 3)
Seq 10: Position R under Parent (Seq 1)
Seq 11: Position R under Parent (Seq 2)  ← Fill all R's last
Seq 12: Position R under Parent (Seq 3)
```

Pattern: **L,L,L,M,M,M,R,R,R** (NEW LOGIC)

---

## Why This Matters

### 1. **Spillover Fairness**
With global L→M→R:
- First 3 members go under Parent 1, 2, 3 (all L positions)
- Next 3 members go under Parent 1, 2, 3 (all M positions)
- Last 3 members go under Parent 1, 2, 3 (all R positions)

This distributes spillover evenly across all parents in BFS order.

### 2. **Reward Distribution**
Layer rewards are triggered when positions fill. With correct ordering:
- All parents get their first child (L) at roughly the same time
- All parents get their second child (M) at roughly the same time
- All parents get their third child (R) at roughly the same time

This ensures fair reward distribution timing.

### 3. **Business Rule Compliance**
The business specification states:
> "Use strict BFS (breadth-first search) order with L→M→R priority"

This means:
- **Breadth-first**: Fill all positions at one depth level before going deeper
- **L→M→R priority**: Within each level, prioritize L over M over R

The current implementation violates breadth-first by completing individual parents before filling the full level.

## Code Comparison

### WRONG (Current):
```sql
-- This finds the FIRST available position (L, M, or R) for the FIRST parent
SELECT pos_option
FROM unnest(ARRAY['L', 'M', 'R']) AS pos_option
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM matrix_referrals
    WHERE parent_wallet = mr.member_wallet
      AND position = pos_option
)
LIMIT 1  -- Returns first match: L for first parent, then M, then R
```

Result: Fills Parent1's L,M,R, then Parent2's L,M,R, then Parent3's L,M,R

---

### CORRECT (Fixed):
```sql
-- For each position (L, then M, then R), find the FIRST parent missing that position
FOR v_position IN SELECT unnest(ARRAY['L', 'M', 'R']) LOOP
    SELECT mr.member_wallet INTO v_parent
    FROM matrix_referrals mr
    WHERE mr.layer = v_current_layer
      AND NOT EXISTS (
          SELECT 1 FROM matrix_referrals mr2
          WHERE mr2.parent_wallet = mr.member_wallet
            AND mr2.position = v_position
      )
    ORDER BY mr.created_at ASC
    LIMIT 1;  -- Returns first parent missing THIS specific position

    IF v_parent IS NOT NULL THEN
        RETURN v_position, v_parent;
    END IF;
END LOOP;
```

Result: Fills all L's (Parent1, Parent2, Parent3), then all M's, then all R's

## Impact Assessment

### Database Statistics:
- **Total Matrices**: 1,518
- **Total Placements**: 52,569
- **Matrices Using OLD Logic**: 100%
- **Matrices Using NEW Logic**: 0%

### Verification Query:
```sql
-- Check if any matrix uses correct L,L,L,M,M,M,R,R,R pattern
SELECT
    COUNT(CASE WHEN fill_order = 'L,L,L,M,M,M,R,R,R' THEN 1 END) as correct,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN fill_order = 'L,M,R,L,M,R,L,M,R' THEN 1 END) as incorrect,
    COUNT(*) as total
FROM (
    SELECT
        matrix_root_wallet,
        string_agg(position, ',' ORDER BY m.activation_sequence) as fill_order
    FROM matrix_referrals mr
    INNER JOIN members m ON mr.member_wallet = m.wallet_address
    WHERE mr.layer = 2
    GROUP BY matrix_root_wallet
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 9
) t;
```

Current Result:
- Correct: 0
- Incorrect: 100%
- Total: ~1500 matrices

## Solution

1. **Fix the function** `find_next_bfs_position_with_depth` using the corrected code
2. **Rebuild all matrix data** from scratch
3. **Verify** using the validation queries in `matrix_fixes.sql`
4. **Expected result**: All matrices show L,L,L,M,M,M,R,R,R pattern

---

## Testing After Fix

### Quick Test (Layer 2):
```sql
-- Should show L,L,L,M,M,M,R,R,R
SELECT string_agg(position, ',' ORDER BY m.activation_sequence) as pattern
FROM matrix_referrals mr
INNER JOIN members m ON mr.member_wallet = m.wallet_address
WHERE mr.matrix_root_wallet = '0x479ABda60F8c62a7C3fba411ab948a8BE0E616Ab'
  AND mr.layer = 2;
```

### Full Test (All Layers):
```sql
-- Check layer 3 (27 positions)
-- Should show: L repeated 9x, M repeated 9x, R repeated 9x
SELECT position, COUNT(*) as count
FROM matrix_referrals mr
INNER JOIN members m ON mr.member_wallet = m.wallet_address
WHERE mr.matrix_root_wallet = '0x479ABda60F8c62a7C3fba411ab948a8BE0E616Ab'
  AND mr.layer = 3
GROUP BY position
ORDER BY position;

-- Expected:
-- L: 9
-- M: 9
-- R: 9
```
