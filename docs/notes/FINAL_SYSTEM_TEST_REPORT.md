  - Tier 3 (30,000-99,999): Quarter rewards (0.25x multiplier)
  - Tier 4 (100,000-268,240): Eighth rewards (0.125x multiplier)

**BCC Release Schedule:**
- Level 1: 100 BCC base (adjusted by tier multiplier)
- Level 2: 150 BCC base
- Level 3: 200 BCC base
- ...increasing by 50 BCC per level
- Level 19: 1000 BCC base
- **Total Locked**: 10,450 BCC for Tier 1

**Release Mechanism:**
- BCC moves from locked to transferable balance
- Automatic release upon level upgrade

  - Level 2: 150 USDC
  - Level 3: 200 USDC
  - ...increasing by 50 USDC per level
  - Level 19: 1000 USDC

**Special Requirements:**
- **Level 2**: Requires 3 direct referrals
- **R-slot Rewards**: Requires upgrader to be Level 2+
- **Blockchain Verification**: Transaction hash validation for mainnet/testnet

**Upgrade Process:**
1. Verify upgrade requirements
2. Validate blockchain transaction (if not simulation)
3. Update member level and owned levels
4. Process BCC unlock for new level
5. Activate pending rewards that can now be claimed
6. Trigger new layer rewards if applicable

### 6. Cross-chain Withdrawal System ✅

**Features Implemented:**
- **Multi-chain Support**: Arbitrum, Polygon, Base, Optimism
- **Withdrawal Limits**: Daily and monthly limits per user
- **Fee Calculation**: Platform fees + network fees
- **Thirdweb Integration**: Server wallet for automated processing
- **Status Tracking**: Complete withdrawal lifecycle management

**Withdrawal Process:**
1. Check balance and limits
2. Calculate fees (platform + network)
3. Create withdrawal request
4. Deduct amount from balance (escrow)
5. Process via Thirdweb Engine
6. Update status with transaction hash
7. Refund on failure

**Supported Assets:**
