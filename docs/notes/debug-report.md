# User Debug Report: 0x47098712EeEd62d22B60508A24B0ce54C5EDD9eF

## üîç Investigation Summary

**User Address:** `0x47098712EeEd62d22B60508A24B0ce54C5EDD9eF`

**Status:** ‚ùå User does not exist in cloud database

## Findings

### Cloud Database Status (Supabase)
- ‚ùå **users table**: No records found (both lowercase and original casing)
- ‚ùå **members table**: No records found  
- ‚ùå **referrals table**: No referral records
- ‚ùå **Connection logs**: No wallet connection history
- ‚ùå **Activities**: No user activity records
- ‚ùå **Similar addresses**: No case variations found

### Frontend Behavior
- ‚úÖ Frontend shows `isRegistered: true` 
- ‚ùå Frontend shows `hasNFT: false`
- üîÑ Frontend shows `userFlow: 'claim_nft'`

## Root Cause Analysis

The user appears to have **incomplete/failed registration**:

1. **Frontend State vs Database State Mismatch**: 
   - Frontend believes user is registered (possibly cached/local state)
   - Cloud database has no record of this user
   
2. **Registration Process Interruption**:
   - User likely started registration but it never completed successfully
   - Database transaction may have failed or rolled back
   - Network interruption during registration API call

3. **Address Case Sensitivity Issues** (General):
   - Database may have inconsistent address casing
   - Need normalization to ensure all addresses are lowercase

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Address Normalization Script
Created `/database/address-normalization.sql` with:
- ‚úÖ Lowercase conversion for all existing wallet addresses
- ‚úÖ Triggers to auto-normalize future addresses
- ‚úÖ Indexes for case-insensitive queries
- ‚úÖ Covers all tables: users, members, referrals, balances, etc.

### 2. Debug Function
Created `/supabase/functions/debug-user/index.ts` for comprehensive user debugging

## Immediate Recommendations

### For This Specific User:
1. **Clear Frontend State**: User should disconnect wallet and clear browser cache
2. **Re-register**: User needs to complete registration process again
3. **Monitor**: Watch for successful database insertion during re-registration

### For System-Wide Fix:
1. **Run Address Normalization**: Execute the SQL script on production database
2. **Update Registration Flow**: Add better error handling and retry logic
3. **Add Verification**: Implement database confirmation step in registration

## Prevention Measures

1. **Database Triggers**: Auto-normalize addresses to lowercase
2. **Better Error Handling**: Robust transaction management in registration
3. **State Sync**: Ensure frontend state matches database state
4. **Monitoring**: Add logging for failed registrations

## Next Steps

1. Execute address normalization script on production database
2. Have user clear browser data and re-register
3. Monitor registration completion in cloud database
4. Consider implementing user state validation endpoint

## Technical Details

```sql
-- Example normalization query
UPDATE users SET wallet_address = LOWER(wallet_address) 
WHERE wallet_address != LOWER(wallet_address);

-- Create normalization trigger
CREATE TRIGGER normalize_wallet_address_trigger
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION normalize_wallet_address();
```
