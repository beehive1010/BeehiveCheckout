BeeHive System – Final Logic Specification (for Replit Agent)
1) Global 3×3 Matrix

The entire company shares one pyramid matrix.

Each user has 19 layers under them:

Layer 1 = 3 members.

Layer 2 = 9 members.

Layer 3 = 27 members.

… continues until Layer 19 (3^19 members).

Spillover placement (BFS rule):

New members, whether direct referrals or overflow from above, are always placed in the first available slot of the matrix using breadth-first search (BFS).

Layer 1 always capped at 3.

2) Membership & NFT Purchase

Level 1 activation: Buy BBC Member NFT Level 1.

Cost = 130 USDT (100 USDT counts as NFT rewardable price, +30 USDT always goes to admin).

Levels 2–19: Each level has its own NFT cost (150 → 1000 USDT).

Upgrade purchase rules:

Members can buy NFTs sequentially upward: Level 1 → Level 2 → … → Level 19.

No headcount requirement to purchase. Buying higher levels is always allowed as long as it is sequential (no skipping).

3) Rewards & Conditions
General Rule

When a member in your Layer n purchases Level n NFT, a pending reward = NFT price is created for you.

To collect the reward, you must:

Own Level n NFT or higher.

Fulfill any special condition (see below).

If not claimed within 72h → reward 100% rolls up to the nearest qualified upline (who owns Level n or higher).

Special Rules

Level 1 (Warrior)

3 × 100 USDT rewards (from your first 3 members).

The 3rd reward is locked unless you upgrade to Level 2. Otherwise, after 72h it rolls up.

Note: Extra 30 USDT goes to admin and is not rewardable.

Level 2 (Bronze)

Each of your Layer 2 members (9 seats) pays 150 USDT → creates 9 × 150 USDT rewards.

To collect these rewards you must:

Own Level 2 NFT or higher, AND

At least one of your Layer 1 members must also have upgraded to Level 2.

Levels 3–19

Rewards equal to that level’s NFT cost (200–1000 USDT).

No headcount requirement.

As long as you own the Level n NFT (or higher), you can collect rewards from Layer n.

4) 72-Hour Countdown & Roll-Up

All rewards enter a 72-hour pending state.

If conditions are met → reward becomes claimable and can be withdrawn to wallet.

If not → 100% of the reward is passed up to the nearest qualified upline at that level, and a new 72-hour timer starts for them.

✅ Summary for Agent:

Company-wide 3×3 BFS matrix (3, 9, 27 … up to 19 layers).

Level purchase is always sequential, no headcount required.

Rewards = NFT price at that layer.

Special rules:

Level 1 → 3rd reward requires L2.

Level 2 → requires L2 + one direct also L2.

Level 3–19 → only need to own that level or higher.

72h roll-up: if not qualified in time, reward passes 100% up to nearest eligible upline.
