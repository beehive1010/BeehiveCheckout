4. Reward Timing & Pass-Up Logic
Direct Referral Reward: Paid instantly (no countdown).


Level Upgrade Rewards:


Generated when a downline member upgrades to a given level.


Each reward is locked under a 72-hour countdown.


To unlock: Upline must already be upgraded to that level (and for Bronze, must also have 3 directs).


If unlocked within 72h → Claimable instantly.


If not unlocked → 100% of the reward is passed up to the nearest qualified upline, and a new 72h countdown starts for them.



5. Earnings Wallet
Shows:


Balance (claimable earnings)


Pending rewards + countdown timers


Functions:


Claim: Move unlocked rewards into balance instantly


Withdraw: (optional) Convert balance to USDT payout


Re-use: Balance can also be reused for upgrades (depending on product design)



✅ One-Sentence Summary:
 The BeeHive system = 130 USDT entry (100 referral + 30 admin), 19-level sequential upgrades (150–1000 USDT), 3×3 automatic spillover matrix, dual rewards (instant referral + 72h level rewards with pass-up), and an earnings wallet for pending/claimable rewards.
