3. Matrix Structure
3×3 Matrix System


Each member’s first layer can have up to 3 people.


After the first layer is full, new members are automatically placed (“spillover”) into the next available slot in the downline.


Effect: Even if a new member is not directly sponsored by you, if they spill into your team matrix, you still receive the corresponding level rewards.



4. Reward Mechanisms
1) Referral Reward
Every new member you directly invite gives you 100 USDT immediately.


No time limit, no upgrade requirement.


Pure referral bonus, unlimited.



2) Level Upgrade & Unlocking Conditions
Bronze (Level 2):


Condition: Must have 3 direct referrals (Warriors)


Pay 150 USDT to upgrade


Unlocks Bronze rewards (when downline in 2nd layer upgrades to Bronze, you earn 150 USDT each).


Silver (Level 3):


Pay 200 USDT to upgrade


Unlocks Silver rewards (when 3rd layer downline upgrades to Silver, you earn 200 USDT each).


Gold → Mythic Peak (Levels 4–19):


Pay the required fee for each level


Each level unlocks corresponding downline rewards (250–1000 USDT)


No additional referral requirement (only Bronze requires 3 directs).



3) Reward Distribution Rules
Immediate Payout: Direct referral bonus (100 USDT) is paid instantly.


Level Rewards (from downline upgrades):


When your downline upgrades, the system generates a pending reward for you.


Each pending reward has a 72-hour countdown.


Unlock Condition:


You must have already upgraded to the same level.


For Bronze, you must also have 3 direct referrals.


Claim: If you meet the conditions within 72 hours, you can click “Claim” and the reward will be instantly credited.


Auto Upstream (Pass-Up): If you do not meet the conditions within 72 hours, the full reward amount is 100% passed up to the nearest qualified upline, and a new 72-hour countdown starts for them.



4) Earnings Wallet
Every member has a “Earnings Wallet” that shows:


Balance (claimable earnings)


Pending rewards with countdown timers


Members can click “Claim” to move unlocked rewards into their wallet balance immediately.


Wallet balance can be:


Withdrawn to wallet (optional), or


Reused for upgrades/other purposes (depending on product design).



5. Examples
Example 1: Referral
Member A refers 3 people (each pays 130 USDT).


A receives: 100 × 3 = 300 USDT immediately.


Example 2: Upgrade to Bronze
A has 3 directs and pays 150 USDT to upgrade to Bronze.


When A’s 2nd-layer downline upgrades to Bronze, A earns 150 USDT each.


If 9 people in A’s 2nd layer upgrade → 150 × 9 = 1350 USDT.


Example 3: 72h Pass-Up
Member B’s downline upgrades to Silver, generating 200 USDT reward for B.


If B upgrades to Silver within 72 hours → B can claim the 200 USDT.


If B fails to upgrade → the 200 USDT is passed up 100% to the nearest upline who has Silver, with a new 72-hour timer.



6. Backend Responsibilities
Blockchain layer:


Only records NFT Claim + USDT payments.


Backend system:


Maintains referral binding (immutable).


Validates upgrade payments against level costs.


Issues referral rewards instantly.


Generates level rewards with 72h countdown and pass-up logic.


Manages 3×3 matrix placement and spillover.


Provides members with their Earnings Wallet data and claim function.



✅ Summary for Agent
 The BeeHive system works as follows:
Entry = 130 USDT (100 to sponsor, 30 to admin).


Level progression: pay 150 → 1000 USDT step by step.


3×3 matrix with automatic spillover.


Rewards:


Direct referral reward: instant 100 USDT each.


Level rewards: generated when downline upgrades, subject to 72h countdown. If conditions are met → claim instantly; if not → reward is 100% passed up to the next qualified upline.


Backend orchestrates all logic. Blockchain is only used for proof of payment (USDT) and proof of membership (NFT Claim).
