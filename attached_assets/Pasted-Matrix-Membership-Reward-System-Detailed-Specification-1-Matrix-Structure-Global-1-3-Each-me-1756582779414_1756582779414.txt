Matrix Membership & Reward System (Detailed Specification)
1. Matrix Structure (Global 1Ã—3)

Each member is the root of their own 1Ã—3 sub-tree.

Downlines are filled in strict order: Left â†’ Middle â†’ Right (L â†’ M â†’ R).

Each layer d can hold 3^d members:

Layer 1 = 3 members

Layer 2 = 9 members

Layer 3 = 27 members

â€¦ Layer 19 = 3^19 members

Placement logic:

New members are inserted globally according to activation order (only active members can enter the matrix).

Members always fill the first available slot at the lowest depth possible.

Placement flows Left first â†’ Middle â†’ Right, ensuring Layer 1 is filled before Layer 2, and so on.

This global spillover system means downlines can come from direct referrals or spillover from higher uplines.

2. Membership Levels & Upgrades

NFT Membership Levels progress as follows:

Level 1 = 100 USDT

Each higher level adds +50 USDT

Level 19 = 1000 USDT

Reward value = 100% of NFT price (unless overridden by admin settings).

Upgrade rules:

Members must upgrade sequentially.

Must own Level N before purchasing Level N+1.

Membership upgrades are not tied to team size â€” purely based on purchasing the NFT.

Activation requirement: Only members who purchase Level 1 become part of the global matrix system.

3. Reward Triggering (Layer-Based Logic)

Rewards are triggered by the upgrading memberâ€™s position in the rootâ€™s matrix:

When a downline in Layer N upgrades to Level N, the root receives the corresponding reward.

Example:

A downline in Layer 1 upgrades to Level 1 â†’ Root gets 100 USDT.

A downline in Layer 2 upgrades to Level 2 â†’ Root gets 150 USDT.

â€¦ A downline in Layer 19 upgrades to Level 19 â†’ Root gets 1000 USDT.

Special case (Layer 1):

The 3rd reward (Right position) only unlocks if the root has upgraded to Level 2.

General case (Layers 2â€“19):

The root must hold Level N NFT to qualify for Layer N rewards.

4. Eligibility & Pending Rewards

To receive a reward, the upline/root must have membership_level â‰¥ N.

If qualified â†’ reward is confirmed immediately.

If not qualified â†’ reward is created as pending with a 72-hour countdown (configurable).

If the upline upgrades to the required level within 72h â†’ reward becomes confirmed.

If not â†’ reward expires and is reallocated upward.

5. Spillover / Reallocation

If a pending reward expires (after 72h), the system searches upward through the referral/matrix chain.

The first ancestor with membership_level â‰¥ N receives the reward.

If no one qualifies all the way up â†’ the reward is redirected to the platform account (or other fallback defined by admin).

6. Special Platform Revenue

Only Level 1 upgrades generate +30 USDT platform revenue, recorded in platform_revenue.

Levels 2â€“19 â†’ default 0 platform fee (can be overridden by admin config).

7. Full Summary (How It Works Together)

Matrix placement: Members enter the 1Ã—3 global matrix when they activate Level 1 NFT. Placement fills strictly from top down, Left â†’ Middle â†’ Right, ensuring global spillover.

Upgrade-driven rewards:

Rewards are not tied to recruitment count, but to NFT level purchases.

Each level corresponds to a specific layer: Layer N â†’ Level N â†’ 100% NFT price reward.

Eligibility rules:

Root must hold the corresponding NFT level to earn rewards from that layer.

Exception: Layer 1 Right slot requires the root to upgrade to Level 2.

Pending & countdown:

Unqualified uplines get pending rewards for 72h.

They must upgrade in time to claim, otherwise reward flows upward.

Reallocation: Expired rewards search up the tree until a qualified ancestor is found. If none, platform account collects.

Platform revenue: Only Level 1 upgrades trigger a fixed +30 USDT fee to the platform.

ðŸ‘‰ In plain words:

Matrix = placement system (who goes where).

Rewards = triggered by upgrades within your own 19 layers.

Eligibility = you must hold the right NFT level.

Pending = 72h grace.

Reallocation = unclaimed rewards move up.

Platform cut = only on Level 1.
