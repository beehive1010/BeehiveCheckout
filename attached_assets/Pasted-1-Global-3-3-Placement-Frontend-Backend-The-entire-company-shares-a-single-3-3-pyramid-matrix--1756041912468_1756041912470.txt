1) Global 3×3 Placement (Frontend & Backend)

The entire company shares a single 3×3 pyramid matrix.

Layer 1: exactly 3 seats for A (A’s first layer).

Layer 2: 3×3 = 9 seats; Layer 3: 9×3 = 27 seats; … up to Layer 19 (size = 3^layer).

Spillover (BFS): regardless of direct referrals or overflow from above, members are placed by join time using BFS to the first available slot under A. Layer 1 is always capped at 3.

2) Upgrades & Qualification

Upgrade = buy the corresponding Level Member NFT (on-chain proof). It does not depend on having a full 3×3.

To receive a layer’s rewards, you must own that Level’s NFT (or higher).

Sequential purchase: you may buy multiple levels in one go, but they must be recorded step-by-step (no skipping).

Level 1 special case: Among the 3 rewards from A’s Layer 1, the 3rd reward is locked until A upgrades to Level 2; otherwise it follows the 72-hour pass-up.

3) Costs & Rewards (Layer-Linked)

Level 1 entry: 130 USDT total — 100 USDT counts as the NFT price & distributable reward; 30 USDT goes to the admin wallet.

Levels 2–19: the NFT price = 100% reward amount paid to the nearest qualified upline when a member in that layer buys that level.

Trigger: a reward is created for you when someone in your Layer n buys Level n.

Layer	Required Level	NFT Price / Reward (USDT)	Max Seats (3^layer)	Qualification You Must Hold
1	L1	100 (from 130; +30 admin fee)	3	L1 (3rd seat requires L2)
2	L2	150	9	L2
3	L3	200	27	L3
4	L4	250	81	L4
5	L5	300	243	L5
6	L6	350	729	L6
7	L7	400	2,187	L7
8	L8	450	6,561	L8
9	L9	500	19,683	L9
10	L10	550	59,049	L10
11	L11	600	177,147	L11
12	L12	650	531,441	L12
13	L13	700	1,594,323	L13
14	L14	750	4,782,969	L14
15	L15	800	14,348,907	L15
16	L16	850	43,046,721	L16
17	L17	900	129,140,163	L17
18	L18	950	387,420,489	L18
19	L19	1000	1,162,261,467	L19

Note: At Level 1, only 100 USDT is rewardable; the additional 30 USDT always goes to the admin wallet.

4) 72-Hour Countdown & Roll-Up

When a member in your Layer n buys Level n, a pending reward (amount per table) is created for you and a 72-hour countdown starts.

If you hold Level n (or higher) within 72h, the reward becomes claimable.

If not, at expiry it passes up 100% to the nearest qualified upline, and a fresh 72-hour timer starts for them.

Level 1 special: the 3rd seat also follows this rule unless you upgrade to L2 in time.

5) FE/BE Alignment (Action Items)

BFS spillover placement shared by FE & BE; Layer 1 fixed at 3, then 3, 9, 27…

Upgrade = buy Level NFT; Qualification = own that Level (or higher) to receive.

Reward engine: trigger on “Layer n member buys Level n” → amount = Level price → 72h lock → unlock if qualified → else roll up.
