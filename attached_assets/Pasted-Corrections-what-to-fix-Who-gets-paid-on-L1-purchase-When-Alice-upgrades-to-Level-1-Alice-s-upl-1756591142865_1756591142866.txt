Corrections (what to fix)

Who gets paid on L1 purchase:
When Alice upgrades to Level 1, Aliceâ€™s upline (depth 1 above Alice) gets $100 (not Alice).
Rewards are always per-root: when your Layer N member upgrades to Level N, you (the root) get that Level-N reward (if you hold â‰¥ that level).

Alice as root â€” Layer 1 (L, M, R):
When Bob/Middle (Layer1) buys Level 1 â†’ Alice gets $100 (claimable).
When Charlie/Left (Layer1) buys Level 1 â†’ Alice gets $100 (claimable).
When David/Right (Layer1) buys Level 1 â†’ Alice gets $100 (PENDING) â†’ unlocks after Alice upgrades to Level 2; pending window = 72h (admin-config).

Layer 2 rule:
When a member in Aliceâ€™s Layer 2 upgrades to Level 2, Alice gets $150, but only if Alice is Level 2.

Platform revenue:
Only Level-1 purchases add +$30 per purchase to platform revenue (Levels 2â€“19 = $0 unless overridden).

Corrected mini test (step-by-step)

Alice upgrades to Level 1

Aliceâ€™s upline gets $100.

Platform +$30 (L1 purchase event).

Bob (Aliceâ€™s Layer1â€“L) upgrades to Level 1

Alice gets $100 (claimable).

Platform +$30.

Charlie (Aliceâ€™s Layer1â€“M) upgrades to Level 1

Alice gets $100 (claimable).

Platform +$30.

David (Aliceâ€™s Layer1â€“R) upgrades to Level 1

Alice gets $100 (PENDING) â†’ unlocks when Alice reaches Level 2 (72h countdown applies).

Platform +$30.

ðŸ‘‰ At this point, Aliceâ€™s Layer-1 total = $300 (2 claimable + 1 pending).
Platform revenue across these 4 L1 purchases = $120 (4 Ã— $30).

Next placements:
After Aliceâ€™s Layer 1 (L, M, R) is filled, new activated L1 members (from Aliceâ€™s direct or global spillover) fill Aliceâ€™s Layer 2 in order: Left â†’ Middle â†’ Right across the layer, then proceed to deeper layersâ€”always fill the lowest layer first.

Layer 2 rewards:
When any Layer 2 member upgrades to Level 2, Alice earns $150 only if she has upgraded to Level 2; otherwise itâ€™s pending (72h) and then reallocated upward if still unqualified.

Acceptance checks (quick)

L1 events pay the purchaserâ€™s upline $100; platform +$30.

As root, you earn when your Layer N upgrades to Level N.

Layer-1 Right reward is pending until root is L2 (72h gate).

Eligibility: root must hold â‰¥ N to confirm Layer-N rewards; else pending â†’ reallocate upward after 72h.

Placement: strict L â†’ M â†’ R, fill current layer fully before moving to next.
