hat I See in Your Contract
Your contract is named BeeHiveMembership and the relevant function is:
￼
￼
￼
￼
function mintWithTokens(address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
    require(paymentToken != address(0), "Payment token not set");
    require(tokenId == 1, "Only tokenId 1 can be minted");
    require(!hasMinted[to], "Already minted");
    require(paymentToken.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= mintPrice + platformFee, "Insufficient balance");
    require(paymentToken.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= mintPrice + platformFee, "Insufficient allowance");

    // Transfer payment
    require(paymentToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, treasury, mintPrice), "NFT payment failed");
    require(paymentToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, platform, platformFee), "Platform fee payment failed");

    // Mint NFT
    _mint(to, tokenId, 1, "");
    hasMinted[to] = true;
}
￼
￼
Key Points to Check
1. Approval Target
• You must approve the contract itself(0x99265477249389469929CEA07c4a337af9e12cdA) to spend your USDC, not the NFT contract address variable.
• In your code, you have:
￼
￼
￼
￼
params: [NFT_CONTRACT, BigInt("130000000")];
￼
If NFT_CONTRACT is the same as 0x99265477249389469929CEA07c4a337af9e12cdA, this is correct.
2. Allowance Amount
• The contract checks for mintPrice + platformFee.
• Make sure you approve at least mintPrice + platformFee (130 USDC, with correct decimals).
3. Has Minted
• If the user has already minted, the function will revert.
4. Token ID
• Only tokenId == 1 is allowed.
5. Payment Token Set
• paymentToken must be set in the contract.
6. Treasury and Platform Addresses
• Both must be set and not zero.
￼
What to Fix / Try
• Check that you approve the contract address(0x99265477249389469929CEA07c4a337af9e12cdA) as the spender.
• Check that you have not already minted (only one mint per address).
• Check that your USDC balance and allowance are both ≥ 130 USDC (with correct decimals).
• Check that the contract’s paymentToken, treasury, and platformaddresses are set.
